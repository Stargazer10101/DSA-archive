# Curating a Concise Set of Questions (along with my implementation) for DSA Practice

## 📌 Introduction
This repository aims to provide a well-structured and concise set of questions for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The questions are carefully selected to cover fundamental concepts, commonly asked interview problems, and important coding patterns.

## 🏆 Objectives
- **Efficient Learning**: Focus on essential problems that maximize understanding.
- **Topic-Wise Questions**: Categorized by data structure and algorithm type.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep track of solved and pending questions.
- **Optimal Solutions**: Provide efficient and well-explained solutions.


Each problem file contains:
- Problem statement
- Input/Output format
- Constraints
- Approach & Solution
- Code Implementation

## 📖 Topics that will be Covered
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Searching & Sorting
- Bit Manipulation
